Guess The Number — Python Game

Overview:
Guess The Number is a console-based Python game where the player must guess a secret number randomly generated by the computer. The game is designed to test logic, luck, and deduction, offering multiple difficulty levels, hint systems, and two playing modes — Single and Survival.
Each session adapts dynamically: as you win more rounds, the difficulty automatically increases until you reach the final Impossible level.

 Game Objective

Your goal is to correctly guess the computer’s secret number within the allowed number of attempts.
You can play a Single Game for one quick round, or a Survival Mode where you start with three lives and continue until all lives are lost.
Every three wins, the game automatically raises the difficulty to keep things challenging and rewarding.

 Core Features
Feature	Description
 Game Modes	Choose between Single Game (one round) or Survival Mode (three lives).
 Difficulty Levels	Easy → Medium → Hard → Extremely Hard → Impossible. Each has unique ranges, attempts, and hint rules.
 Hint System	Easy–Hard: Full hints (unlimited). Extremely Hard & Impossible: Limited hints (5 or 2).
 Progression	Every 3 wins increases the difficulty automatically.
 Error Handling	Handles invalid inputs and interruptions gracefully using try/except.
 Replay Option	After each session, you can choose to play again or exit cleanly.
 Lives System	Survival mode tracks remaining lives and ends when all are lost.
 Game Flow

At the start of the program, the player is greeted with a welcome message and asked if they are ready to play.
If they proceed, the following steps occur:

Choose a difficulty
Each level determines:

Number range (e.g., 1–20 for Easy)

Maximum attempts allowed

Hint availability (full or limited)

Choose a game mode

Single: One round only.

Survival: Three lives; lose one per failed round.

Play the round

A random number is generated within the selected range.

The player makes guesses, and the game responds with “Too high” or “Too low”.

In limited hint modes, hints reduce after each use until none remain.

Check result

If guessed correctly → display success message and increment win counter.

If failed all attempts → lose one life (Survival mode) or end (Single mode).

Difficulty progression
After every three wins, the game automatically increases the difficulty level.
If already at Impossible, it remains there until the player loses.

End of session

When lives reach zero → display “Game Over” message.

Player is then prompted to play again or exit.

 Example Gameplay
===================================
      WELCOME TO GUESS THE NUMBER
===================================
Test your luck and logic!
Are you ready to play? (yes/no): yes

Choose difficulty: Easy / Medium / Hard / Extremely Hard / Impossible
> easy
You chose: Easy

Choose mode: Single game or Survival mode
> survival

I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 20.
You have 6 attempts.

Please enter your guess: 7
Too high! Try again.
Please enter your guess: 3
Too low! Try again.
Please enter your guess: 5
Correct! You guessed it in 3 tries.

 Difficulty 
Level	Range	Max Attempts	Hint Mode	Hint Limit
Easy	1–20	6	Full	Unlimited
Medium	1–50	8	Full	Unlimited
Hard	1–100	8	Full	Unlimited
Extremely Hard	1–150	8	Limited	5
Impossible	1–1000	5	Limited	2
Code Structure Overview

Main Components:

DIFFICULTIES — A dictionary storing each difficulty’s range, attempts, and hint rules.

difficulties() — Asks for user difficulty input and returns a copy of the chosen settings. The .copy() prevents the global dictionary from being modified during gameplay.

choose_mode() — Prompts the user to pick Single or Survival mode and assigns the appropriate number of lives.

init_game_state() — Initializes the current game’s settings, including range, attempts, score, and random secret number.

main_game(settings) — Core gameplay loop; checks user guesses, provides hints, and determines whether the player wins or loses.

try/except Handling — Ensures invalid inputs (letters, out-of-range values) or keyboard interrupts are handled smoothly.

 Game Logic Summary

The game begins by displaying a welcome message and asking the player if they are ready to play. Once the player agrees, they are prompted to choose a difficulty level and a game mode. Each difficulty level defines the number range, maximum attempts, and hint type (either full or limited). After the setup, the program generates a random secret number within the chosen range, and the guessing phase begins.

During the guessing loop, the player enters their guesses one at a time. The program validates each input, ensuring it is a number within the specified range. Depending on the difficulty and hint mode, the game provides feedback such as “Too high” or “Too low,” and in limited hint modes, the available hint count decreases each time a hint is used. The game also tracks the number of attempts and hints used throughout each round.

If the player correctly guesses the number, the game displays a success message and updates the win counter. Every three wins, the difficulty level automatically increases to the next stage, up to the maximum “Impossible” setting. In Survival Mode, the player retains their current lives and continues playing at the new difficulty.

If the player fails to guess the number within the allotted attempts, they lose one life in Survival Mode or end the game immediately in Single Mode. When all lives are lost, the game displays a  message, signaling the end of the session. The player is then given the option to play again or exit the program entirely.

 Error Handling and Input Validation

The game is built with several layers of input validation and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. First, all guesses are checked to confirm that they are numeric values and fall within the valid range of numbers for the chosen difficulty level. This prevents crashes caused by unexpected input types.

Mode and difficulty selections are also validated, accepting flexible input formats such as “survival,” “Survival Mode,” or simply “s.” If the player types something invalid, the program politely asks them to try again rather than terminating abruptly.

Additionally, the game handles manual interruptions gracefully. If the player uses keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl + C or sends an end-of-file signal (EOF), the program catches the resulting exceptions (KeyboardInterrupt and EOFError) and exits cleanly with a thank-you message. The replay loop at the end of each session also includes validation to prevent crashes if a user types something unexpected, such as leaving the input blank or entering a random word.

Together, these checks make the game more robust, ensuring that no matter what the player enters, the program always responds in a controlled and user-friendly way.

 Planned Future Enhancements

Several improvements are planned to make the game even more engaging and interactive. One of the first additions will be a scoring system, where players earn points based on the number of attempts used, the current difficulty, and whether hints were taken. Higher difficulties will apply score multipliers, rewarding players for greater challenges.

A statistics tracker will also be added to record information such as total wins, average attempts per round, and most frequently played difficulty level. This will give players insight into their performance and encourage improvement over time.

The next enhancement involves sound effects, using the pygame library to add short audio feedback for correct and incorrect guesses, as well as background music to create a more immersive experience.

A persistent leaderboard feature is also planned, allowing the game to store and load high scores from a file such as scores.json. This will make progress tracking possible across sessions.

Finally, unit testing scripts will be introduced to simulate user input and random number generation. This will allow the developer to test the program automatically and ensure that key features, such as input validation, progression logic, and error handling, continue working as intended after future updates.
